DEPRECATED Android app forwarding SMS messages to Telegram bot
==============================================================

This repository is now taking a well-deserved retirement.
I have switched over to a non-Android phone which means I can't really give this app the testing it deserves.
Plus, with my main job keeping me busy, I just don't have enough time to keep up with support.
At last, since I've moved to a country where SMS OTPs aren't often used, this service doesn't really suit my needs anymore.

However I'll be keeping hold of the [https://smsq.me](https://smsq.me/) domain until at least January 1, 2025
because I want to avoid potential phishing attacks by preventing sneaky domain re-registration.
After that, the domain might just go back into public access.
In the meantime, feel free to fork the project and make it feel at home under your own domain.

It is just a handy thing when you work on your laptop.
You probably don't want to pick up your phone every time you need to enter an OTP code.
